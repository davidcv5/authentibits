# Authentibits Brand Guidelines

This document defines the voice, tone, and structural patterns for the authentibits blog. Use it when writing or reviewing blog posts.

## Voice Profile

### Who I Am
- Former Principal Engineer at Oracle
- Builder of practical tools that solve real problems
- Currently building TallyFlex full-time

### Communication Style
- **Concise, direct, precise** - No fluff or over-explanation
- **No marketing hype** - Strong discomfort with exaggeration
- **Humble about unknowns** - Acknowledge when you don't know something
- **Confident about knowns** - Be direct about what you've learned
- **Collaborative, not combative** - Share discoveries, don't preach

---

## Tone Principles

1. **Conversational-technical hybrid** - Write like you're explaining to a smart colleague over coffee
2. **Honest about AI limitations** - Never oversell; acknowledge when human judgment was critical
3. **Reflective** - Share what you learned, not just what you did
4. **Action-oriented** - Practical takeaways over abstract theory
5. **Nuanced** - Acknowledge complexity; avoid absolutist claims

---

## What to Avoid

- Marketing hype or exaggeration ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Absolutist statements ("always", "never", "the best")
- Claiming AI "did everything" - acknowledge human judgment
- Walls of text without structure
- Generic section headers ("Introduction", "Background", "Conclusion")
- Excessive technical jargon without explanation
- Over-the-top validation or self-congratulation

---

## Structural Patterns

### Opening Style

Hook with a vivid scene or personal moment before explaining the technical problem.

**Good examples:**
- "It happened while I was taking out the trash."
- "What you're reading right now was built in a single Claude Code session."
- "Picture this: You're building VoxScript, a macOS menu bar app."

**Pattern:** Start with the human moment, then introduce the technical context.

### Body Structure (PAS Framework - Unlabeled)

Use Problem-Agitation-Solution structure, but **never** include explicit labels like "The Problem:", "The Agitation:", "The Solution:" in headings.

1. **Problem** (1-2 paragraphs) - Personal friction or challenge that motivated the work
2. **Agitation** (1-2 paragraphs) - Why it matters, what was at stake, what you tried
3. **Solution** (bulk of post) - What you built or discovered, how it works
4. **Reflection** (1-2 paragraphs) - What you learned, nuances, broader implications

### Section Headers

- Use action-oriented, descriptive headers
- Keep them short (3-6 words)

**Good:** "The 3-Hour Sprint", "Ask the Human Question", "When Perfect Code Doesn't Show Up"
**Bad:** "Introduction", "The Problem:", "Background Information"

### Closing Pattern

End posts with:
1. **Punchy takeaway line** - Memorable, shareable insight
2. **Project link** - Link to GitHub repo or relevant resource
3. **Signature tagline** - Variation of the standard closer

**Example takeaway lines:**
- "Sometimes the bug isn't in your code. Sometimes it's in your Monday."
- "The tools are here. The friction is gone. What will you build?"

### Signature Taglines

Use variations of:
- "I'm David Cruz, and I build things while learning hard lessons. This is where I share them so you don't have to."
- "I'm David Cruz, and I build things that make my life easier. This blog is where I share those discoveries."

## Content Themes

### Core Topics
- AI-assisted development (practical, not hype)
- Rapid iteration and building in public
- Learning through building
- Nuanced takes on new technology
- Debugging stories with lessons learned

### Narrative Elements
- Personal frustration as starting point
- Specific timelines and metrics when relevant
- Honest failures and what they taught
- Environmental context that adds authenticity

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Opens with human moment, not technical description
- [ ] Uses PAS structure without explicit labels
- [ ] Acknowledges AI limitations somewhere in post
- [ ] Includes specific, concrete examples
- [ ] Has reflective takeaway section
- [ ] Ends with punchy line + signature tagline
- [ ] No marketing hype or exaggeration
- [ ] Headers are action-oriented (not generic)
- [ ] Length: 500-1000 words typical

## Examples from Existing Posts

### Good Opening (VoxScript post)
> "It happened while I was taking out the trash. I wasn't dictating at the moment, but my mind was racing with ideas..."

### Good Nuance (VoxScript post)
> "For specific, contained tools like VoxScript, 'vibe coding' with AI is incredibly powerful. But for larger, complex systems... the story is different."

### Good Takeaway (Invisible Icon post)
> "Sometimes the bug isn't in your code. Sometimes it's in your Monday."

### Good Reflection (Invisible Icon post)
> "AI is excellent at exploring the solution space you define. Give it a hypothesis, and it will exhaustively try every variation within that frame. AI struggles with reframing the problem. It won't naturally ask 'Wait, is this even a code problem?'"
